                        <h3>SELF-COMPASSION</h3>
                        <p>It's common to be our own harshest critics, which can erode self-esteem and hinder personal growth. This
                            self-criticism often arises from unrealistic expectations or past failures.</p>

                        <p>Stepping out of your comfort zone can be intimidating, yet it's essential for personal development. Fear of
                            failure or the unknown often holds us back from pursuing new opportunities.</p>

                            blocks often stem from self-doubt, perfectionism, or external pressures.</p>
